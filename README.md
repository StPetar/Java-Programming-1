# S2-Prog
Semester 2 Java Programming Class

The assignment for this semesters prerequisite for the exam was to create a basic functions calculator(plus and minus functions) using only Strings.

We then had to expand the functions with other ones usually found in a calculator such as times and power of 2

Ultimate goal was to be able to calculate a quadratic formula (ax^2+bx+c) using integer regardless of their lenght.
