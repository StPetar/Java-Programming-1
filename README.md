# S1-Prog
Semester 1 Java Programming Class

In this semester the prerequisite for the final exam was to create a basic calculator(plus and minus functions) using only Strings.

After that I needed to expand the function of the calculator to such a point that the correct calculation of a quadratic formula(ax^2+bx+c) using integer, regardless of their lenght, would be possible.
